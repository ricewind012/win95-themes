## Options

### Colors

Available options:

- Hotdog Stand
- VGUI (military green previously used in Steam)
- Windows 2000

Note that only the default option respects the system's light/dark/high contrast theme preference.

### Reduced game list entry height

Makes the game list entries' height smaller.

Only use this if you patched Steam! Run `./scripts/patch steam` in the repo's directory to apply the patches (Linux only).
