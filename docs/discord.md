# Discord

## Usage
0. Install Vencord/Vesktop.
1. Open the Settings > Themes > "Online Themes" tab.
2. Copy & paste the following into the text box:

```

## Caveats
- No icons (yet).
- Some parts of the theme are locked behind the "English (US)" locale (change in Settings > Language).
- Sidebar list items are huge due to rendering issues with lazy-loading.
